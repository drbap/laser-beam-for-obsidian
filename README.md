**Laser beam** is a plugin for Obsidian.md designed to enhance your reading experience by utilizing customizable laser lines.  These lines are virtual guides meant to improve reading focus and concentration.

## Overview and Features

> Default theme - laser line (blue)

- **Customizable Laser Lines**: You can choose between 2 laser focus types, **laser line** or **laser area**, to personalize your reading experience and find what works best for you.

- **Improved Focus**: The laser lines guide your eyes across the page, line by line, minimizing distractions and keeping you on track. This can be particularly helpful for people who struggle with maintaining focus while reading.

- **Colors**: blue, green, orange, yellow, red, pink, purple (7 colors).

## Functionality

**Desktop version**:

- You can select **static** status to have a fixed laser position.
- The laser lines will **follow the text cursor** (**caret**).

**Mobile devices**: Touch the screen to select the desired laser line location.


## Command Palette

- You can activate/deactivate the laser line using the **Command Palette** or by setting a keyboard **shortcut**. You can also toggle between laser line and laser area (focus type).
